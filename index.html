		<h1> What Is Hot Wheels? </h1>
		<p> Since 1968, Hot Wheels have been a collectible die-cast toy car made by Mattel. Each vehicle is a scale representation of various makes and models by the likes of General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Motors, and others. The franchise also includes racetrack sets and the popularity of Hot Wheels has extended into movies, animation and games. Hot Wheels' main competitor for years was Matchbox until Mattel purchased Tyco (who owned Matchbox at that time) in 1996.</p>
